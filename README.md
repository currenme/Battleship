# Battleship
This program represents a  battleship game that I created in Java. This game allows a user to play individually against a computer, for two users to play against each other, either on the same machine, or on different machines through networked interactions. 

In this game I use a wide range of computer science techniques including, but not limited to, multithreading, polymorphism, object-oriented design, graphical user interfaces, and networking.  

I created this program alone from scratch and have been working on it individually since February of 2015. The program has over 20 classes and over 3660 lines of code, and I wrote all of it myself*. 

All of the external images and sound are in Resources and all of the code itself is in the src/currenme_CSCI201_Assignment5 folder. 

To compile, create an empty project directory on your computer called "currenme_CSCI201_Assignment5" and then pull the github code and run it using a Java compiler.  Thank you. 

*small exception: I wrote everything myself from scratch except for when I used USC's Sound Library (SoundLibrary.java - 56 lines of code).
